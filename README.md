# Sinusoidal Graphs

This is a C++ project created in QtCreator. The aim is to develop an application
that students can use to practice and improve their understanding of sinusoidal
(sine and cosine) graphs.
The initial version only contains an option for adjusting parameters in a 
sinusoidal function and immediately seeing the effect on the graph.

## Built with

[QT Creator](https://www.qt.io/ide/) - 3.5.1 based on Qt 5.5.1
Running on Ubuntu 16.04 64 bit

## Intended improvements:
* An option that quizzes students showing a labeled graph and having them input
the correct equation.
* An option that quizzes students by having the student manipulate a graph by 
draging two points to match a given equation.
* Tutorial information to teach students about sinusoidal graphs.
* Word problems that put the learned principles into practice modeling real
world behavior.
